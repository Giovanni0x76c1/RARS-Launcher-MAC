# RARS-Launcher-MAC

Original software: https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars

This is a launcher which contains RARS1_6.jar developed by Benjamin Landers TheThirdOne.
This app doesn't want to replace the original one, but the original on macOS didn't correctly display the items to open.
Requires java to be installed.
